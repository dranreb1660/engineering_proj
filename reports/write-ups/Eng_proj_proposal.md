### Question/need:
* Fantasy Premier league: That weekly ritual of re- thinking your team you spent hours beuilding a few days/ week before, which player to select out of over 700 players to help you overcome the over 8 million fpl managers or within your friends group. What if there was a model that gives you the possible high point scorers in each gameweek? In this project, we will build a model that will predict points a player will score in the coming gameweek given his previous week statistics. 

### Data Description:
* The data we will use is from the [Official Fantasy Premier Leage](https://fantasy.premierleague.com) API
* The data contains all previous week stats from over 700 players. 
* I will use a player's previus weeks' stats to predict the points of the player in the next gameweek?
### Tools:
* Data Acquisition and storage and Modeling
  * Python
  * pandas
  * SQL
  * Scikit-learn
 * Deployment
   * Flask
   * Docker 
* Will also use Google Cloud Platform should more computation and storage resources be needed. 

### MVP Goal:
* Baseline Linear regresor to predict next gameweek points
